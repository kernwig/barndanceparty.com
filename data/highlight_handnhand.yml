  <p>Starting with January 2024, Adam with Barn Dance Party is the official club caller for the Hand â€˜n Hand Square Dance club!</p>
  <p>
    We have been volunteering with this group for people with learning disabilities for several years, 
    and am honored to be selected. Every week, Barn Dance Party calls and teaches square dance, 
    line dance, contra, and other fun dances for this wonderful group.
