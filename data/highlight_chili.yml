  We were contacted by the event coordinator of a community HOA. 
  She was planning a chili cook-off and thought it we be fun to do some square and line dancing while the votes were tallied. 
  We thought that sounded fun too!
  
  <blockquote>
    So much FUN!
    
    Diana and Adam brought the PARTY to our party! The music was perfect, the set-up was professional, and the line dancing and square dancing lessons were a BLAST! Highly recommend!
