title: "üîé Highlight: Fundraiser at 3Faces Ranch ‚Äì June 2023"
content: |
  <p>Raji found us online while looking to add square dancing and music to ‚Äúa private fundraiser for a non-profit that provides scholarships for high functioning mentally disabled adults and homeless veterans.‚Äù We were all in on this!</p>
  
  <p>We overnighted in our travel trailer on the ranch, since it was a long drive for us (thanks!) and got set up early to play music for the setup crew.</p>
  
  <p>As the guests arrived and had their fill for lunch, the dancing began! They learned to square dance, contra dance, and several line dances as the afternoon went on.</p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>Great couple! Fun to work with!</p>
  
    <p>Diane and Adam were awesome to work with. They are very sweet, professional, enjoyable to interact with and helped provide suggestions to make my square dance party a success. I highly recommend them!</p>
