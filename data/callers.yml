        Diana’s first passion has always been in music. 
        She’s been learning, playing, and collecting since her teen years, when she also frequented dance clubs and
        took up square dancing with her family.
      <p/>
      <p>
        After some years off to raise her own family, she returned to the world of squares in 2012 and a few years later,
        started to call square dancing. As a life-long teacher, Diana has a particular love of introducing children to dance. 
        As a music aficionado with over ten thousand songs in her collection, becoming a DJ as well was a natural move

        Adam discovered his latent dance skills in the early 2000’s. Combined with his passion for sharing knowledge, 
        he immediately took to assisting in square dance classes as an “angel” dancer. 
        That has since led to learning to lead the class as a square dance caller.

        While his first love is the social atmosphere of a square, don’t be surprised if he jumps in to show you the way in lines,
        contra, ballroom, or free styling!

      <p>
        Adam is making his mark in the world of square dancing as the author of the 
        <a href="https://sqac.fanello.net/" target="sqac">Square Auto-Choreographer</a> and
        <a href="https://kernwig.github.io/squarecue/" target="squarecue">SquareCue</a> apps,
        sharing innovative tools with other callers.
