  <p>
    A new groom 🤵‍to be was looking for some background music for his wedding reception. 
    No dancing, no speeches planned (although that didn’t stop the father of the bride 🤭), and no special requests. 
    Just simple. Not a problem we assured him, we can just hide in the corner and play the tunes. 🎵 And so we did. 👍

  <blockquote>
    We had a very small wedding reception last month (about 80 people). 
    We decided not to do the traditional reception, with dancing, loud music, etc. 
    However, we realized we still needed some music to play in the background as people mingled. 
    We put out a request for wedding DJs to play our little event. We specifically stated that we only needed a DJ for
    two hours to play low key (country) music in the background. We need some ambience while people mingled. 
    We received a number of expensive quotes from DJ’s that wanted to charge us their “standard” wedding fee. 
    This is when Diana and Adam Fanello swooped in to offer us a reasonable price. 
    They read the description of our event and tailored a price that was within our budget. On the day of the wedding,
    they arrived on time, were professional, friendly and played exactly the type of music we requested. 
    We are nothing but pleased with their services. I would recommend them to anyone… 
    especially if they’re looking for country or barn dancing themed music. 🙂

  <p>Thank you for the testimonial Michael. We were very happy to be able to “swoop in” and play our little part in your special day! 💒 Congratulations once again.</p>
  <p>Of course we aren’t limited to country, that’s simply what Michael wanted. If you want any pop, rock, new wave, standards, classical, soundtracks, children’s songs, Christmas tunes, blues, alternative, indie, western, or country from across the past eighty years of recorded music, our collection of over ten thousand songs are waiting to be played!</p>
