    A bride-to-be contacted us, wanting something a little different for her wedding ‚Äì square dancing! 
    Initially she was just looking for us to teach some introductory square dance to the guests. 
    When the plans for a band didn‚Äôt pan out, we stepped up to provide recorded music. Over the months, 
    as the planning continued, we found ourselves more and more involved until the final plan:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Violin concertos as the guests arrive for the ceremony</li>
    <li>Microphone/PA for the ceremony</li>
    <li>Special entry and exit songs, which we had to hunt down!</li>
    <li>American standards for the pre-reception and meal</li>
    <li>Guest participation first dance: square dance teach and dance!</li>
    <li>Post party of guest requests!</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We had our small setup for the ceremony, and large setup for the reception. Oh, and did mention this is all in Fillmore among horse stables and orange groves! üåÑüêéüçä</p>  
  <p>It was a smash success! Thirty-two members of the wedding party and guests joined in for a joyous time learning to square dance, and the after-party included requests from Spice Girls to ‚Äútheme from Jurassic Park‚Äù!</p>
  <p>Before we even completed our long drive home, the new bride had already sent in her testimonial!</p>
  <blockquote>
    <b>Great music at a great wedding</b><br>
    These guys were super great as both square dance callers and wedding DJs. They provided excellent music during the ceremony, cocktail hour, rehearsal and dancing. They also taught us to square dance and played your standard wedding pop music so almost everyone got on the floor.<br>

  Thank you Sarah for the kind words and allowing us to be part of your special day.
