  A young mother contacted us with:
  <blockquote>
    It’s a 1st birthday party. We thought it’d be cute to have a caller for square dance with the moms and babies.
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>Cute idea indeed! 😍</p>
  
  <p>The party was booked but a few days before, the forecast was threatening rain! Uh oh. With canopies offered by both parties and an offer by us to reschedule with their same deposit transferred, if they wish… the party went ahead as planned!</p>

  <p>We’ll let the client’s testimonial the next day speak for itself:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><b>Awesome and Fun Caller Duo!</b></p>
    <p>What a joy! We hired Adam and Diana for my daughters 1st birthday—a hoedown. They arrived on time and were super accommodating when it forecasted rain at the last minute. I provided an easy pop up tent and they brought their own as well, just in case.</p>
    <p>The music and range of dances they taught us were really great. Diana helped us with the steps and was very patient with the fact that many of us had never done Square dance. Adam was a great caller and humored us during many inevitable missteps lol! Between dances they DJ’d and it was just tons of fun.</p>
    <p>They’re both square dancers themselves and I have no doubt they’d be great callers for any party situation. 10/10</p>
