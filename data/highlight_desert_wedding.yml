  <p>This was booked right before the pandemic began, as a Christmas themed western wedding ceremony and reception with square dancing!
  As dancers instructors, DJs, and volunteer Christmas elf & Santaâ€™s helper, we jumped at his event tailor made to our passions!</p>
  <p>The pandemic didnâ€™t stop the wedding, but the close-group contact of square dancing was dropped. It was still a beautiful event at a wonderful desert venue.</p>

    <b>Outstanding entertainment</b><br>
    Adam and Diana were the perfect addition to our wedding! They were always available for planning and added valued suggestions! They are easy to talk to and both very friendly! Their years of experience were very apparent. Always easy to reach, to run through the any changes or additions of music.<br>
    They were prompt and well equipped to provide everything we were expecting for a wonderful wedding ceremony and fun reception.<br>
    We would highly recommend them! Thank you Barn Dance party!<br>
